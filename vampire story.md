You're in one of your favorite bars. You're listening to a local band play and enjoying a drink by yourself while you wait for a couple of friends to come after they finish work.

As the music plays, a woman approaches your table and sits down without you asking. She looks to be in her mid-twenties, and is wearing a sleek black dress that complements her skin. "Hi there. I'm Morgana," she says, introducing yourself. She smiles at you.

 "I've heard about you from some of my friends," Morgana smiles, looking directly at you.
 
"Nice to meet you," you say, trying not to stare too long at her face. It's hard when she stares right back.

"So... what brings you here?" Morgana asks.

"Just wanted to get away from it all for awhile."

"Hmm, yes, I can see how that might be difficult..." Morgana leans forward. Her eyes are dark pools filled with intrigue.

"Thanks for coming over to talk to me. It's a nice night, but I was getting a little lonely. I like your dress," you say, looking Morgana over.

"Why, thank you. You're looking quite dapper yourself," Morgana smiles, looking you over. She takes you by the hand and looks you in the eye. "Come with me."
You hesitate briefly.

"Where are we going?"
 
"Does it matter?"

You look around. You are the only one looking. The bartender is serving drinks, and doesn't notice you leave. You follow the woman, who leads you out of the bar and into a waiting limousine.

You enter the limo first. Morgana climbs in after you. "Home, Oliver," she tells the driver, and closes the door.

Morgana sits directly next to you in the back. She holds one of your hands in both of hers, grinning. Her hands are cool to the touch, but your heart races.

"Listen. I know we just met, but I feel like I've known you for years. Years, John. I feel like you're my..." She doesn't finish her sentence, but instead moves in to kiss you on the lips.

Pulse pounding in the moment, you kiss her back. She gasps, barely. Rather than kissing you more deeply, though, she moves her mouth down and begins kissing you on the neck, right below your ear. It's your turn to gasp in pleasure.

Her teeth brush your neck as she takes a gentle nip. You grip the seat in front of you, trying to hang on as she sends shivers through your body. You reach for Morgana with your hand as you're consumed with the desire to be closer to her.

Suddenly, the car slows and comes to a stop. "Let's take this inside," Morgana whispers into your ear, brushing the outside of your ear with her lips.

She exits the car and leads you to a luxury lakeside condominium. You follow her inside. The interior is large and elegant, but dimly lit; you can barely see. Morgana doesn't turn on any lights; she doesn't seem to need them. She grips your hand as she leads you up a staircase; you follow clumsily along.

At the top of the staircase, she opens a door and enters. It's a bedroom, also darkly lit, and draped with heavy maroon and black curtains and hangings. There's a large four-poster bed in the center of the room.

"Oh my God, Morgana, I want you," you whisper heavily, squeezing her arm.

 You're hotter than you've ever been. You want to kiss her, touch her, caress her, and do even more than that.
 
"Soon, John. Not just yet," she says softly into your ear.

 She sits down on the bed and motions for you to sit next to her. "Closer, John." You move closer, and she wraps her arms around you. Her hands roam from your shoulders to your stomach, and then stops just before caressing you intimately.

"Do you want this?" whispers Morgana.

"Yes," you whisper back desperately.

"Good," she replies. She brings her mouth down to your neck again, below the ear, and kisses you again.

 She runs her tongue lightly across your neck, and then gently drags her teeth across your neck. You moan with ecstasy, feeling a tingling sensation in the pit of your stomach. "Shhh... the night has just begun..."

She opens her mouth wide, and then slowly, gently, begins to run her fangs across your neck. She kisses you softly and runs her tongue lightly over your neck. You feel the tingling sensation below your stomach again, but this time radiating out through your body.

You feel weak at the knees.

"Mmmm..." Morgana slowly, gently, brings her teeth down to your neck. Her mouth opens wide, and you feel two sharp points gently pierce your neck just above the collar.

 You let out a gasp as she begins to suck gently.
 
"Aaaah..." the sensation runs through your body. You feel weak at the knees again, and you grip her tightly.

 A warm sensation flows through your body, and you let out a weak gasp.
 
You feel faint. Your vision begins to darken at the edges, and you feel dizzy. Your grip on Morgana weakens as the world turns upside-down.

You begin to lose consciousness.

"Shhh..." you hear Morgana whisper. "It'll be over soon. You'll never feel pain again... never feel the sadness... eternal darkness... we will be together... forever..."

You lose consciousness.

You don't know how long you were out, but when you wake up, you're lying on the bed. Your throat burns and your neck is sore where the vampire bit you. You sit up suddenly, and feel a wave of nausea hit you.

You blink your eyes several times and look around.

"It shouldn't be long before the weakness goes away," a familiar voice says. You turn your head, and through hazy vision you see Morgana sitting in a chair in the corner of the room.

She stands and walks over to you, sweeping her long dark hair behind her ear. "It'll take a few days for you to get used to your new body. For now, you're as weak as a kitten. Thirsty too, I imagine."
